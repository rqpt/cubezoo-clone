                    <p>
                    We use an agile philosophy and scrum technique to develop 
                    products, as opposed to the traditional waterfall methods. Our 
                    clients can see, touch and test their product during production,
                    instead of waiting for the final product.

                    <h3>01. User Research</h3>
                    <p>
                    We work with our clients to understand their business case and 
                    customers. We use popular research methods, such as surveys 
                    and interviews, to understand how technology is used by real 
                    people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We target specific users, learn about their needs and 
                    frustrations, and use the information to enhance customer 
                    satisfaction.
                    </p>
                    <h3>02. Project Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                    We use the information from user research to find the best 
                    rated findings and best user practices. We may even create a 
                    persona to assist the creative team when designing for the 
                    correct audience. Bundling the client's expectation with the 
                    right user experience leads to a well received product.

                    <h3>03. Design & Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>
                    We create wireframes as a basic outline of the product 
                    architecture. It conveys, navigation, direction and 
                    description of the user interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Designing interfaces involves thinking about how users will 
                    interact with them and what kind of experiences they will have. 
                    We want users to have positive experiences with products that 
                    look good and are easy to use. Gamifying can make your design 
                    more fun and engaging where appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Prototyping works best for test cycles as this helps to ensure 
                    that the product is correctly understood and user-friendly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>04. Software Development</h3>
                    <p>
                    We choose code frameworks based on what will work best for our 
                    client's project. For example, a Flutter app may be less 
                    expensive to develop than a Native app. Therefore our strategy 
                    is adopt a programming language that is both reliable and scalable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our development team are paired in groups. The front-end 
                    development team handles the product's user interface and 
                    experience, while the backend development team handles the 
                    product's functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Developed progress is presented and shared client side weekly 
                    to biweekly until the project is completed and geared for launch.

                    Testing is defined as a software testing type, conducted 
                    through scripts with the sole motive of finding errors in code. 
                    It deals with tests for the entire web or app solution. It 
                    helps to enhance the quality of a product while reducing costs, 
                    maximising ROI, and saving development time.

                    <h3>06. Further development</h3>
                    <p>
                    We recommend launching our client's product with a soft launch 
                    or pilot first. Also known as an early release. This will help 
                    to identify any areas of concern and allow us to improve the 
                    product before release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We analyse our products after launches to make sure they meet 
                    our standards. All software we create comes with a maintenance 
                    plan that keeps it stable and free of technical issues.

                            Warehousing may seem to be a simple case of holding and 
                            releasing stock, but it requires a lot of work behind the 
                            scenes to make it function smoothly. The major networks 
                            such as Vodacom, MTN, CellC and Telkom, for example, have 
                            hundreds of thousands of stock items, ranging from SIM 
                            cards to devices.
